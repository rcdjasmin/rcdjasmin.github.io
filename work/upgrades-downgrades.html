        <h5>01 <strong>Background</strong></h5>
        <p>Commerce is a new feature that allowed business owners who sell products on sales channels like Amazon or Shopify to manage their inventory in QuickBooks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Exclusive to Plus and Advanced plan subscribers, this project marks its first release to paying customers, so it was critical to address the following scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Downgrading:</strong> When users switch to lower plans, they lose access to our feature. We must ensure seamless offboarding without data loss or disruptions to their books.</li>
            <li><strong>Upgrading:</strong> Subscribers on higher plans should have the option to use the new feature, but we needed to build a mechanism for enabling or disabling it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        1 x product manager<br>
        1 x tech lead<br>
        1 x product designer<br>
        3 x software engineers<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>While the core team remained lean, the challenge was working with 6 other teams, scattered across 4 countries.</p>

            <h5>03 <strong>Audit</strong></h5>
            <p>Since it’s a QuickBooks feature, we didn’t need to start from scratch. Instead, we conducted an in-app audit to understand existing subscription flows.</p>

        <h5>04 <strong>Collaboration</strong></h5>
        <p>In addition to technical complexities, we had to collaborate efficiently with other teams. To facilitate this, I created flowcharts progressing from plain text to visual user journey maps and wireframes.</p>

            <h5>05 <strong>Design solutions</strong></h5>
            <h2>Upgrading and enabling inventory tracking</h2>
            <p>After aligning our approach, ideation began. One focus was enabling higher plan users to access the new feature, requiring a toggle mechanism. Due to a technical limitation, users had to enable the feature for all channels or none, leading us to place the control in Account Settings temporarily.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Though this cut down on engineering work, it posed the challenge of distinguishing it from the existing inventory management feature, prompting exploration of various solutions:</p>

                <img src="../images/upgrades-downgrades-toggle-options@2x.jpg" style="max-width:1110px;">
                <figcaption>While the ideal state is the first option, we went with third option as we didn’t have enough controls to warrant a separate page yet</figcaption>

            <br>
            <h2>Downgrading and disabling inventory tracking</h2>
            <p>Another area of focus is around downgrading to lower plans, ensuring that users can get offboarded without losing data and causing unexpected disruptions to their books.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In this flow, we tried to minimize the friction, and focus on the bare minimum that users need to do before moving to their desired plan.</p>

        <div class="center-container">
            <h2>Audit log and email notification</h2>
            <p>Early on in our discovery research, we recognized a need for businesses with multiple team members to track when inventory tracking is enabled or disabled by others.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To address this, we proposed updating the audit log and sending email notifications to all admin users whenever the toggle is changed.</p>

        <h5>07 <strong>Results</strong></h5>
        <p>Despite facing technical limitations and navigating cross-geographical collaboration hurdles, we successfully launched the upgrade/downgrade flows on schedule, and the new feature was effectively rolled out to our paying users.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If given the chance I would keep track of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>number of Commerce users who upgrade or downgrade successfully contacting support</li>
            <li>support tickets from users who toggled inventory tracking for sales channels on or off</li>
        </ul>
