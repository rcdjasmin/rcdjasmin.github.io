        <h2>Free tools</h2>
        <p>To improve the SEO on our existing free tools pages, I was asked to develop a free online version of the tools that can be accessible on the page itself without downloading anything. Some examples include Shipping Label Generator, Reorder Point Calculator, and Sales Forecast Tool.</p>

        <h2>Improving the knowledge center</h2>
        <p>The knowledge center houses over 900 support articles. I collaborated with another designer to execute the design mockups. The new theme makes the support site more consistent with the marketing site in terms of branding and navigation.</p>
        <img src="../images/sidebar.gif" style="max-width: 250px;margin: 20px auto;display: block;">
        <p>To make it easier to navigate, I added a dynamic list of categories and articles on the sidebar so that the user does not have to leave the current page to browse the contents of the knowledge center.</p>

        <h2>Blog refresh</h2>
        <p>Prior to the redesign, the blog is just a paginated collection of all posts sorted by publish date. With the new design, the recently published posts are shown per category. A list of popular posts has been added as well. The new design allows more content to be showcased and promotes the different categories in the blog.</p>

        <h2>Enhancing the Careers page</h2>
        <p>For a growing start up, talent acquisition was important. To support this, the careers page is redesigned to improve the UX and to show more of the company's culture.</p>
