        <h5>01 <strong>Background</strong></h5>
        <p>QuickBooks is an accounting software that has historically underserved product-based businesses. A new offering called ‘Commerce’ aims to bridge this gap through improved inventory management features.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Based on data and customer feedback, we observed low engagement among early users of Commerce, who feel lost due to <ol><li>lack of guidance, and</li> <li>disjointed information architecture</li></ol></p><p> With the introduction of new features for Commerce, we had an opportunity to work on the first issue, and guide users from account setup to experiencing the benefits of Commerce.</p>

        <h5>02 <strong>My role</strong></h5>
        <p>The team composed of a product manager, tech lead, another product designer, content designer, and three software engineers. My responsibilities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User research and testing:</strong> Leading user interviews and synthesizing the results.</li>
            <li><strong>Design delivery:</strong> From creating wireframes, prototypes, annotated mockups, to participating in multiple bug bashes and QA rounds with the team.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Helped in identifying priorities and organizing them into milestones.</li>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> Worked with customer success and content teams to create support articles and how-to videos.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>03 <strong>Work</strong></h5>
        <h2>Connecting a channel</h2>
        <p>The first step a user takes to start using Commerce is to connect a sales channel. We had to balance getting the essential information to setup while not overwhelming users.</p>
        <br>

        <br><br>
        <h2>Introducing the new inventory feature</h2>
        <p>Due to the inherent complexities of inventory management and our own limitations for beta, we had to find a way to simplify this for users.</p>
        <br>
        <div data-autoplay="true" data-loop="true" data-wf-ignore="true" class="video-container">
            <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" data-wf-ignore="true" data-object-fit="cover">
            <source src="../videos/inventory-opt-in.mov" data-wf-ignore="true">
            <!--<source src="../videos/newsroom-vid_3-transcode.webm" data-wf-ignore="true">-->
          </video>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>We ran multiple rounds of moderated and unmoderated user tests to find what works, resulting in an animated diagram that shows how data syncs between QuickBooks and the sales channels. I illustrated and animated this diagram using Adobe Illustrator, After Effects, and Lottiefiles.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>After connecting a channel</h2>
        <p>After successfully connecting a sales channel comes another critical point. We’ve seen users drop off at this point as we had little by way of guiding them on what to do next.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="../images/setup-checklist@2x.png">
        <p>To provide more guidance and context here, we implemented:</p>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Setup checklist:</strong> As a short-term solution to the disjointed IA, the checklist guides users throughout various relevant areas of QuickBooks. </li>
            <li><strong>Channel connections:</strong> One challenge is that certain features are accessible only after data import, which can take from a few minutes to a few hours. To manage our user’s expectations, we now show accurate import status, aiming to include more details in the future such as remaining time.</li>
            <li><strong>Tasks:</strong> This serves as an evergreen way of surfacing to users what they need to do.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All the components are reused from our design system, reducing dev effort.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Designing for scale</h2>
        <p>We established a framework to organize and sequence steps because various teams will inevitably be involved in shaping the setup and onboarding process down the line.</p>

        <h5>04 <strong>Result</strong></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Achieved a 6% improvement in completion rates, with a 20% rise in users choosing to import data as far back as possible, enhancing their overall experience and benefits.</li>
            <li>Enhanced retention and engagement rates among users who successfully completed the new setup and onboarding process.</li>
            <li>The highly requested inventory sync feature has gained significant traction, with over half of users opting in within two weeks of its launch.</li>
